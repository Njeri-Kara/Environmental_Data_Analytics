## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the lessons in Environmental Data Analytics (ENV872L) on reproducibility, workflow, and version control. 

## Directions
1. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
2. Use the lesson as a guide. It contains code that can be modified to complete the assignment.
3. Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
Space for your answers is provided in this document and is indicated by the ">" character.
If you need a second paragraph be sure to start the first line with ">".
You should notice that the answer is highlighted in green by RStudio. 
6. When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.
You will need to have the correct software installed to do this (see Software Installation Guide)
Press the `Knit` button in the RStudio scripting panel.
This will save the PDF output in your Assignments folder.
8. After Knitting, please submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the dropbox in Sakai. Please add your last name into the file name (e.g., "Salk_A01_Reproducibility.pdf") prior to submission.

The completed exercise is due on Thursday, 17 January, 2018 before class begins.

## 1) Discussion Questions

### Question
Why are reproducible practices becoming the norm in data analytics?

> Answer: Reproducible data analysis ensures that someone can later produce the same outcomes from the same data and analysis. It is an accountability measure and it allows data scientists to review their analysis process at a later time and get the same result.

### Question
What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: My experience with R is in the Applied Statitics course (ENV 710) I took in fall 2018. I have no prior expereince with Git

### Question
